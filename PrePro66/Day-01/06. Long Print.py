    print("English is a West Germanic language in the \"Indo-European\" language family, \
with its earliest forms spoken by the inhabitants of early medieval England.\
[3][4][5] It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that \
migrated to the island of Great Britain. Existing on a dialect continuum with Scots \
and then most closely related to the Low Saxon and Frisian languages, Modern English \
is genealogically Germanic. However, its vocabulary also shows major influences from \
French '(about 28% of English words)' and Latin '(also about 28%)',[6] plus some \
grammar and a small amount of core vocabulary influenced by Old Norse \
(a North Germanic language).[7][8][9] \\Speakers of English are called Anglophones\\")
